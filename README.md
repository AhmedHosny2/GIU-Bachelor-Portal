# GIU-bachelor-Portal
The bachelor portal aims to provide a way for GIU students to access bachelor project opportunities offered to them. This portal will tackle the whole process of the bachelor project, including the preparation from lecturers, coordinators, TAs, companies, employees, external supervisors, and student registration until the final grading process.
